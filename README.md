Planet Daily

# Purpose
Planet Daily is a work day scheduler that allows the user to input their daily tasks to the planner.
Planet Daily also allows the user to save the tasks and when checking the tasks they will have different colors according to the time stamps. For example if the user has a task at 8 am and the time is currently 8 am the task will show a green color. If the time passes the 8 am timeframe the 8 am will show red.
